# BoardgameRandomizer
This is my first programming project for my portfolio.

The purpose of this program is to be able to choose a random boardgame to play from a user's Board Game Geek collection, based on how many players are playing.

I plan to convert this to a .js file and as I learn more will add more features (ie. specify a gameplay time limit).
